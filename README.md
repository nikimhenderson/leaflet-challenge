# leaflet-challenge
Part 1 of the leaflet challenge only <br/>
Collected earthquake data for the past 7 days from the geojson website from the USGS [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) <br/>
Used earthquake data to plot earthquakes as circles where the size of the circle is equal to its magnitude and the color of the circle is equal to the earthquake's depth (see legend on bottom left hand side)<br/>

Thank you to my tutor Kelli for help finding resources used to create a legend and help in formulating my code<br/>
Thank you to my BCS learning assistant for help determining which additional information belonged in the pop up<br/>
