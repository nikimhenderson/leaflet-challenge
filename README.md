# Leaflet Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to collect data from the past 7 days from the geojson website built by the USGS and visualize that data using Leaflet.js to make an interactive map.
The map displays earthquakes using two dimensions:
1. Magnitude is represented by the size of the circle (higher magnitudes = larger circles)
2. Depth of the earthquake is displayed with the color of the circle (green is -10-10km, yellow is 10-30km ....red is 90+ km)

Collected earthquake data for the past 7 days from the geojson website from the USGS [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) <br/>
Used earthquake data to plot earthquakes as circles where the size of the circle is equal to its magnitude and the color of the circle is equal to the earthquake's depth (see legend on bottom left hand side)<br/>

Thank you to my tutor Kelli for help finding resources used to create a legend and help in formulating my code<br/>
Thank you to my BCS learning assistant for help determining which additional information belonged in the pop up<br/>
